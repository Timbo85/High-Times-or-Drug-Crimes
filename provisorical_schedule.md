## Monday

# 1. Data Cleansing in general 
* missing values
* outlier detection 
    --> let's see wether we can find some good (substantial) arguments for certain strategies and discuss them monday afternoon
# 2. Feature Engineering
* depending on our dataset, let's check if we can construct some cool featrues (this should probabaly help in finding an appropriate business case as well)
* some visualization involved

## Tuesday

# 3. Data-Visualization
* hopefully, we can already tell a good story with the data at hand (and some engineered features)

4. First Models
* find appropriate Models and test different approaches on the training data

## Wednesday

5. Tuning
* hopefully, we can already fine tune some promising models and compare (and time) them against each other!
* our notebook should also get some tuning by then :)

## Thursday

6. Preparstion of Presentation 
* let's make some slides 
* more notebook cleansing
