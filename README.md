# High-Times-or-Drug-Crimes
This is our first machine learnig project. We worked with a dataset conveying information on personality traits and drug consumption. 
For the potential application of our models, we imagined that we wanted to use them for specific drug addiction prevention programs. We did some EDA, 
something that could be called label engineering (i.e. soft clustering) and tested different classification models.
